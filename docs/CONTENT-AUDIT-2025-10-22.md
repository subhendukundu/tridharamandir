## ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUES PENDING - Stakeholder Action Required

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è ALL IMAGES ARE STOCK PHOTOS (Unsplash)
**Problem**: ZERO real temple photography - all images are generic stock

**Current State**:
- Homepage hero: Using `public/images/tridhara-radha-krishna-mandir.png` (verify if real)
- 3 Destination cards: Unsplash stock temples
- 4 Testimonial avatars: Generic faces
- Guest house rooms: Generic hotel photos
- All other images: Unsplash URLs

**SEO/GEO Impact**: üü° **MEDIUM-HIGH**
- Google Images won't show YOUR temple
- AI can't visually describe Tridhara
- Visitors expect REAL photos
- Professional credibility concern

**Action Required**:

2. **Medium-term (Week 2-3)**: Replace with real temple photos

**Problem**: ZERO names of actual people managing the temple

**Current Gaps**:

- ‚ùå No trustee board names
- ‚ùå No spiritual leadership identified
- ‚ùå No temple administration contact (only generic email)

**SEO/GEO Impact**: üü° **MEDIUM**

- Looks anonymous/less authoritative

**Action Required**:
1. **History page**: Add "Founded by [Name], with trustees [Names]"
2. **About section**: Add "Under spiritual guidance of [Name]"
3. **Footer**: Add "Temple Administration: [Names/Roles]"

**Files to Update**:
- [`src/data/history.ts`](../src/data/history.ts)

- Footer content

**Priority**: üü° **HIGH** (impacts authority/trust)

- Twitter: `https://twitter.com/tridharamandir`
- Instagram: `https://www.instagram.com/tridharamandirofficial`
- YouTube: `https://www.youtube.com/@TridharaMilanMandir`
