Tridhara Milan Mandir
Tridhara Milan Mandir (বাংলা: ত্রিধারা মিলন মন্দির) is a Hindu temple complex located in Panchmura, Bankura district, West Bengal, India. The temple is chiefly dedicated to Radha–Krishna and also celebrates the synthesis of the three major Hindu traditions: Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Shaktism. Because of this confluence, it is sometimes referred to as a “Second Vrindavan,” an affectionate nickname used by devotees and local media rather than an official title.
Name & Significance
The name Tridhara Milan hints at a coming together (milan) of three streams (tridhara) — symbolic of the blending of devotion across Shiva, Krishna (Vishnu), and the Goddess (Shakti). This reflects the temple’s mission to unite believers from different sects of Hinduism.
History
The temple was officially consecrated on 1 July 2022, coinciding with the 16th day of the month of Ashara in the Bengali calendar, which fell on the auspicious occasion of Rath Yatra.
Deities & Shrines
While the central worship is towards Radha and Krishna, the temple complex also includes separate shrines for Shiva, Kali, Rama–Sita, Hanuman, and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu.
The main sanctum houses the idols of Radha Krishna and Kali.
In front of it lie two subsidiary temples — one for Mahadev (Shiva) and another for Rama–Sita.
The idol of Krishna is crafted in dark-toned marble, while Radharani is white-toned, both placed on wooden pedestals.
The temple walls are richly decorated with scenes from Krishna’s life, the Dasavataras (the ten incarnations of Vishnu), episodes from the Mahabharata, and various lila (divine play) episodes. The architecture draws from the Nagara style (common in northern India) rather than the traditional terracotta Bengali temple style. The ceiling is supported by shegun (wood) beams and features a central chandelier. A “Tulsimancha” (platform for worship) is located midway along a staircase from both sides.
Visiting: Darshan & Prasad
The temple is open daily from morning until night, with a midday closure from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM during which bhog (food offering) is served. Devotees can receive prasad (sanctified food) for a nominal fee of ₹75 per person. Initially intended for around 600 people daily, the service has expanded and now caters to approximately 2,000 people each day.

Milestones Since Inception
- **2012 – 2016: Community Visioning.** Terracotta artisans, kirtan groups, and Panchmura residents began weekly satsangs to imagine a campus where Shaiva, Vaishnava, and Shakta traditions could worship together. Diaspora families pledged initial donations for land procurement.
- **2016 – 2019: Land & Design.** Trustees acquired the present site, convening architecture charrettes that blended Nagara-style shikhara silhouettes with Vrindavan courtyard planning. Oral historians documented local folk narratives for future murals.
- **2020 – 2021: Construction & Relief.** While artisans carved marble murtis and teak doors, volunteers ran anna-daan kitchens and medical clinics for neighbouring villages during pandemic waves, expanding the daily prasadam service beyond 1,000 plates.
- **1 July 2022: Consecration.** The formal pran pratishtha took place on Rath Yatra, followed by the inaugural integrated Tridhara arati, Tulsi parikrama, and evening Vrindavan Sabha storytelling.
- **2023 – Present: Outreach & Heritage.** Scholarship drives, bilingual guided tours, and archival kirtan recordings continue to grow, with major utsavs—Rath Yatra, Janmashtami, Navaratri—drawing thousands of pilgrims.

Mission & Values
- **Mission — Unity Through Seva:** Harmonise Shaiva, Vaishnava, and Shakta lineages through Radha-Krishna devotion, transparent seva, and community upliftment.
