**Overall Grade: B+ (84/100)**

---

## 1. Technical SEO Foundation

### Strengths ✓
- **Next.js App Router**: Modern framework with automatic optimizations
- **Proper Metadata**: Title templates, descriptions, OG tags configured in [layout.tsx](../app/layout.tsx)
- **Sitemap.xml**: Dynamic sitemap in [sitemap.ts](../app/sitemap.ts) with proper priorities
- **Robots.txt**: Configured in [robots.ts](../app/robots.ts)
- **Structured Data**: Comprehensive JSON-LD implementation (8+ schema types)
- **Canonical URLs**: Set via alternates in metadata
- **Image Optimization**: Using Next.js Image component with responsive sizes

### Issues ⚠️
1. **Missing Performance Optimizations**
   - No evidence of static generation configuration
   - All pages appear to be SSR (Server-Side Rendered)
   - **Recommendation**: Add `export const revalidate = 3600` to semi-static pages

2. **No Internationalization Setup**
   - Single language (English) despite serving Bengali/Hindi audience
   - Missing `hreflang` tags for multilingual content
   - **Recommendation**: Add Hindi/Bengali language versions with proper hreflang

3. **Image URLs Not Optimized for SEO**
   - Using generic Unsplash URLs instead of descriptive filenames
   - Example: `photo-1500530855697-b586d89ba3ee` instead of `tridhara-temple-wedding-ceremony.jpg`
   - **Recommendation**: Replace stock images with actual photos; use descriptive filenames

4. **No XML Sitemap Index**
   - Single sitemap file; could grow large with blog/articles
   - **Recommendation**: Create sitemap index when content scales

5. **Missing Security Headers**
   - No Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, etc.
   - **Recommendation**: Add security headers in next.config.mjs

### Score: 8/10

---

## 2. On-Page SEO

### Strengths ✓
- **Title Tag Optimization**: Template pattern `%s | Tridhara Milan Mandir`
- **Meta Descriptions**: Present on all pages
- **Heading Hierarchy**: Proper H1 → H2 → H3 structure in components
- **Alt Text**: Provided for hero image
- **Semantic HTML**: Using `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>` appropriately
- **Internal Linking**: Navigation structured with hash links and full URLs

### Issues ⚠️
1. **Home Title Too Long**
   - [site.ts:10](../src/config/site.ts#L10): "Tridhara Milan Mandir – Radha Krishna Temple, Panchmura Bankura" = 73 characters
   - Google displays ~60 characters
   - **Recommendation**: Shorten to "Tridhara Milan Mandir | Radha Krishna Temple Panchmura"

2. **Meta Descriptions Generic**
   - [site.ts:11-12](../src/config/site.ts#L11-12): 158 characters, but lacks compelling CTA
   - Doesn't mention "Second Vrindavan," daily anna-daan, or unique differentiators
   - **Recommendation**: Add "Known as Panchmura's 'Second Vrindavan' - serving 2,000 devotees daily. Visit now!"

3. **Missing Schema Rating/Review Aggregation**
   - Only one Review schema ([page.tsx:156-180](../app/page.tsx#L156-180))
   - No aggregate rating shown in SERP
   - **Recommendation**: Add AggregateRating schema with multiple reviews

4. **Keywords Not in First 100 Words**
   - Hero subtitle buries keywords like "Vrindavan," "Bankura," "seva"
   - **Recommendation**: Front-load primary keywords in opening paragraph

5. **H1 Not SEO-Optimized**
   - [content.ts:52](../src/data/content.ts#L52): "Panchmura's Living Confluence of Bhakti" is poetic but weak for search
   - Doesn't include "temple," "Radha Krishna," or "Bankura"
   - **Recommendation**: Consider "Radha Krishna Temple in Panchmura, Bankura | Tridhara Milan Mandir"

6. **Image Alt Text Insufficient**
   - Only hero image has alt; cards using Unsplash lack descriptive alt text
   - **Recommendation**: Add alt to ALL images with location + context

   - No reviews visible, no Q&A feature
   - **Recommendation**: Claim and optimize Google Business Profile; encourage visitor reviews

---

## 5. Content SEO & Keyword Strategy

### Strengths ✓
- **Primary Keywords Present**: "Radha Krishna temple," "Panchmura," "Bankura," "darshan," "prasad"
- **Long-Tail Variations**: "temple wedding Bankura," "guest house near Bishnupur," "annadan seva"
- **Semantic Keywords**: Related terms (seva, bhog, arati, mandir) used naturally
- **Topic Clusters**: Services → Darshan/Bhog/Marriage forms cluster architecture

### Issues ⚠️
1. **Thin Content on Key Pages**
   - Events page only has 2 events ([events.ts](../src/data/events.ts))
   - No blog/article section for long-form content
   - **Recommendation**: Add monthly event calendar + blog with pilgrimage guides

2. **Missing Transactional Keywords**
   - "Book temple wedding Panchmura," "Donate to Radha Krishna temple," "Reserve guest house Bankura"
   - **Recommendation**: Optimize service pages with transactional modifiers

3. **No Comparison Content**
   - Users searching "Panchmura vs Bishnupur temples" or "Why visit Tridhara"
   - **Recommendation**: Create comparison/differentiator content

4. **Underutilized "Second Vrindavan"**
   - Nickname mentioned but not optimized for
   - Few users will search "second vrindavan bankura"
   - **Recommendation**: Create dedicated "Why Called Second Vrindavan" page for branded query

5. **No How-To Guides**
   - Missing "How to reach Tridhara from Kolkata," "How to participate in arati," "How to volunteer"
   - **Recommendation**: Create 5-10 how-to guides targeting featured snippets

6. **Keyword Cannibalization Risk**
   - Multiple pages mention "darshan," "seva," "donation" without clear differentiation
   - **Recommendation**: Map each keyword to ONE primary page; use secondary mentions elsewhere

7. **No People Also Ask Optimization**
   - FAQ section good, but not targeting Google PAA boxes
   - **Recommendation**: Research PAA for "Panchmura temple," "Bankura pilgrimage"; answer those questions

### Score: 7/10

---

## 6. Mobile SEO

### Strengths ✓
- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS with mobile-first breakpoints
- **Viewport Meta**: Likely configured (Next.js default)
- **Touch-Friendly**: Button sizes appear adequate (py-3, py-3.5)
- **Mobile-Optimized Images**: Next.js Image with responsive sizes

### Issues ⚠️
1. **No AMP or Mobile-Specific Schema**
   - Could benefit from AMP for event pages (faster load on 3G)
   - **Recommendation**: Consider AMP for critical pilgrimage timing/directions pages

2. **Hero Content Hidden on Mobile**
   - [HeroSection.tsx:67](../src/components/sections/HeroSection.tsx#L67): Info panel hidden on mobile
   - Important SEO content (consecration date, anna-daan) invisible to mobile crawlers
   - **Recommendation**: CRITICAL - Make mobile visible; affects mobile indexing

3. **Long Form Content May Not Be Mobile-Optimized**
   - History timeline, service details could be hard to scan on mobile
   - **Recommendation**: Add accordion/collapse UI for mobile long-form content

4. **No Mobile-Specific CTAs**

   - Pages likely SSR (slower than SSG)
   - **Recommendation**: Use `generateStaticParams` for service/event pages

2. **External Images from Unsplash**
   - Remote images slower than local hosting
   - **Recommendation**: Download and host images locally in /public

3. **No Lazy Loading Strategy Visible**
   - Images below fold should lazy load
   - **Recommendation**: Verify Next Image uses `loading="lazy"` by default

4. **Potential Bundle Size Issues**
   - Lucide icons imported individually (good) but verify tree-shaking
   - **Recommendation**: Run `next build` and analyze bundle

5. **No Preconnect/DNS-Prefetch**
   - Could preconnect to Google Fonts, Unsplash
   - **Recommendation**: Add `<link rel="preconnect">` to layout

6. **No Performance Budget Defined**

### Issues ⚠️

   - Google may not index these as separate pages/sections
   - **Recommendation**: Consider full `/about` pages OR ensure hash sections have ID attributes

2. **No XML Sitemap Submitted to Search Console**
   - Can't verify if sitemap submitted/indexed
   - **Recommendation**: Submit sitemap.xml to Google Search Console; monitor coverage

3. **Search Functionality Not Implemented**

   - But [search/page.tsx](../app/search/page.tsx) likely not functional
   - **Recommendation**: Implement search OR remove SearchAction schema

4. **Pagination Strategy Missing**
   - If blog/events scale, need rel=next/prev
   - **Recommendation**: Plan for pagination schema if content grows

5. **No Crawl Budget Optimization**
   - Preview page exists ([preview/about/page.tsx](../app/preview/about/page.tsx))
   - Should be blocked from crawlers
   - **Recommendation**: Add /preview/ to robots.txt disallow

### Score: 7.5/10

---

## 9. Link Building & Authority

   - These attract .edu/.gov backlinks
   - **Recommendation**: Publish "History of Panchmura Vaishnavism" or "Architecture of Tridhara" articles

   - Could integrate Disqus or comments for engagement + UGC content
   - **Recommendation**: Add blog with comments OR integrate TripAdvisor reviews
