## The Opportunity

**Most temples will never achieve what you already have.** Wikipedia pages and optimized Google Business Profiles take years to build. You have them now.

**The work ahead is polish, not creation.** 3 months of focused execution transforms 90/100 → 95-98/100 and establishes Tridhara as the digital leader for West Bengal temple pilgrimage.

**Window is time-sensitive.** AI search is exploding (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude). Early movers in GEO will dominate for years. Competitors will catch up eventually—first mover advantage is **now**.

## Recommendation

✅ **Approve ₹90k budget (Option B)**
✅ **Begin Week 1 critical fixes immediately**
✅ **Target 95/100 score in 2 months**

**This investment pays for itself in 30 days through increased guest house bookings and donation inquiries, while establishing decade-long digital authority.**
