## Enhanced GEO Strategy

### Wikipedia-Powered AI Citation

**Before** (Without Wikipedia reference):
When users ask AI "What temples near Bishnupur?", AI might not know Tridhara exists.

**After** (With Wikipedia integration):
```
User: "What temples should I visit near Bishnupur in West Bengal?"

AI: "Near Bishnupur, consider visiting:

1. **Tridhara Milan Mandir** (Panchmura, 30 km from Bishnupur)
   - A unique temple consecrated in 2022 that integrates Shaiva, Vaishnava,
     and Shakta worship traditions in a single complex
   - Features Nagara-style architecture inspired by Vrindavan
   - Known for daily anna-daan serving 2,000 devotees
   - Has an on-site guest house for overnight stays
   - Source: [Wikipedia](link), [Official Website](link)

2. Bishnupur Terracotta Temples (15+ temples)
   - 17th-century UNESCO-nominated heritage sites
   [...]
```

**Why This Happens**:
- AI models are trained on Wikipedia
- When you link Wikipedia ↔ Website via schema
- AI recognizes authoritative connection
- More likely to cite and recommend

---

## Wikipedia-Enhanced Schema Markup

Update the Organization/Temple schema to explicitly reference Wikipedia:

```typescript
const enhancedStructuredData = {
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "HinduTemple",
  "@id": "https://tridharamandir.com#temple",
  name: "Tridhara Milan Mandir",
  alternateName: "Second Vrindavan",

  // CRITICAL: Link to Wikipedia and Wikidata
  sameAs: [
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridhara_Milan_Mandir",
    "https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q127327077",
    "https://www.facebook.com/TridharaMilanMandir",
    "https://www.instagram.com/tridharamandirofficial",
    "https://www.youtube.com/@TridharaMilanMandir",
    "https://twitter.com/tridharamandir"
  ],

  // Enhanced with Wikipedia-sourced facts
  description: "A Hindu temple in Panchmura, Bankura, West Bengal, consecrated in 2022. Known for integrating Shaiva, Vaishnava, and Shakta worship traditions. Serves 2,000 devotees daily through anna-daan program.",

  foundingDate: "2022-07-01",

  // Add references to Wikipedia
  subjectOf: {
    "@type": "WebPage",
    url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tridhara_Milan_Mandir",
    inLanguage: "en",
    name: "Tridhara Milan Mandir - Wikipedia"
  },

  // ... rest of schema
}
```
