## Part 11: Risk Mitigation & Contingencies

### Risk 1: Low Outreach Response Rate

**Scenario**: <20% response rate to email pitches

**Mitigation**:
- A/B test subject lines (track open rates)
- Personalize first paragraph for each target
- Follow up 2-3 times (1 week, 2 weeks intervals)
- Switch to phone calls for high-priority targets
- Offer exclusive incentives (free stay, photo access)

**Contingency**: Focus on directories + social engagement if outreach stalls

---

### Risk 2: Wikipedia Edits Reverted

**Scenario**: Improvements to Wikipedia page get removed

**Mitigation**:
- Declare conflict of interest on Talk page
- Provide high-quality third-party sources
- Make incremental improvements (not major rewrites)
- Engage Wikipedia editors politely
- Follow all Wikipedia guidelines strictly

**Contingency**: Suggest improvements on Talk page, let others edit

---

### Risk 3: Google Review Bombing / Negative Reviews

**Scenario**: Competitors or trolls post fake negative reviews

**Mitigation**:
- Monitor Google reviews daily
- Respond professionally within 24 hours
- Flag fake reviews to Google (takes 3-7 days)
- Encourage genuine visitors to leave reviews (dilute negatives)
- Document evidence of fake reviews

**Contingency**: Have 100+ genuine reviews to offset damage

---

### Risk 4: Media Coverage Doesn't Materialize

**Scenario**: Journalists don't publish features despite pitches

**Mitigation**:
- Diversify media targets (50+ contacts)
- Offer multiple story angles (10 different pitches)
- Build relationships before asking for coverage
- Provide exceptional media kits (photos, data, quotes)
- Host media site visits (increase commitment)

**Contingency**: Create owned media content (blog, YouTube, social)

---

### Risk 5: Budget Constraints

**Scenario**: Limited budget for paid outreach/tools

**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize 100% free tactics (80% of this plan)
- Use free tools (Google Search Console, Google Analytics, free Ahrefs trial)
- Leverage volunteers for content creation
- Barter partnerships (free stay for coverage)
- DIY photography/videography with smartphones

**Contingency**: Execute 80% of plan with zero budget (still effective)

---

### Risk 6: Time/Resource Constraints

**Scenario**: Volunteer team can't commit 80-100 hours/month

**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize Tier 1 targets only (20% effort, 80% results)
- Batch similar tasks (all directory submissions in one day)
- Use templates for efficiency (email, social posts)
- Automate social scheduling (Buffer, Later)
- Delegate specific tasks to volunteers
