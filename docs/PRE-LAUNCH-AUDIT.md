**Status**: üî¥ **NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION**

**Reason**: Zero runtime testing performed. All changes are theoretical.

**Confidence Level**: 60% (code LOOKS correct, but untested)

**Risk Level**: HIGH (deploying untested code)

---

**Next Action**: Run dev server and systematically test every change made today.

**ETA to Ready**: 1-2 hours of testing + fixes

---

**CEO Assessment**: You were RIGHT to question readiness. We need testing before deploy.
