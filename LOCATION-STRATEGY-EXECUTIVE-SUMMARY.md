- Cultural context: Position within Bankura heritage circuit
- Spiritual authenticity: Devotee perspective, not transactional

**Philosophy**: SEO gets them to the page, user value converts them to pilgrims.

---

## Duplicate Content Strategy

### The Challenge
Multiple guides will mention:
- Temple description (Tridhara arati, prasad, timings)
- Guest house details (rates, amenities)
- Etiquette (dress code, photography)

### Differentiation Tactics

#### Tactic 1: Location-Specific Framing
**Don't**: "Tridhara serves 2,000 free prasad daily."
**Do (Kolkata guide)**: "After your 4-hour drive from Kolkata, arrive by 12:30 PM to experience anna-daan prasad alongside 2,000 fellow devotees."
**Do (Asansol guide)**: "Just 1.5 hours from Asansol, you can easily time your visit for 12:30 PM prasad—perfect for a day trip."

#### Tactic 2: Unique Itinerary Integration
- **Kolkata**: Weekend itinerary (2 days, overnight stay)
- **Durgapur**: Flexible (day or weekend)
- **Asansol**: Day trip focus (8 AM - 8 PM)
- **Bishnupur**: Half-day combination with terracotta temples

#### Tactic 3: City-Specific Context
- **Kolkata**: Compare to ISKCON Mayapur (similar distance, different vibe)
- **Durgapur**: Industrial belt positioning, corporate group bookings
- **Asansol**: Gateway for Jharkhand/Bihar devotees
- **Bishnupur**: UNESCO heritage circuit, photographer's paradise

#### Tactic 4: Unique FAQ Sets
Each guide has 5-7 unique FAQs tailored to that city's concerns.

**Acceptable Reuse** (50-100 words max):
- Temple timings table
- Contact information (phone, email, address)
- Schema.org structured data

**Must Be Unique** (100% original):
- Hero section, transportation, itinerary, cost breakdown, combined attractions, FAQs

---

## Internal Linking Strategy

### Hub-and-Spoke Model
**Hubs** (Authority Pages):
- `/plan-your-visit` - Universal planning hub
- `/guides` - All location guides landing page
- `/services` - Booking/donation conversion hub

**Spokes** (Specific Guides):
- City guides link to `/plan-your-visit`, `/guest-house`, `/services`
- Itineraries link to city guides + `/events`
- Festival guides link to `/services/bhog-and-prasad` (prasad booking)

**Cross-Linking Density**: 3-5 internal links per 500 words

### Related Guides Module
Every guide ends with 3-4 card grid:
- Geographic proximity (nearby city guides)
- User intent similarity (weekend vs. day trip)
- Complementary content (transport → itinerary → accommodation)

---

## Call-to-Action Strategy

### 3-Tier CTA Hierarchy

#### Primary CTA (Revenue Focus)
- **Goal**: Guest house booking
- **Placement**: Hero, end of Accommodation section, sticky footer (mobile)
- **Design**: High-contrast button (brand-accent orange)
- **Copy**: "Book Guest House" / "Reserve Your Stay"
- **Link**: Email pre-filled or WhatsApp (future)

#### Secondary CTA (Email Capture)
- **Goal**: Download PDF itinerary
- **Placement**: End of Itinerary section, sidebar widget
- **Design**: Outline button (brand-primary purple)
- **Copy**: "Download PDF Itinerary"

#### Tertiary CTA (Internal Navigation)
- **Goal**: Increase pages/session
- **Placement**: Inline text links, Related Guides module
- **Copy**: "Explore Bishnupur Temples →" / "View Festival Calendar →"

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: Transportation schedules change
**Mitigation**: Quarterly updates + disclaimer ("Verify on IRCTC")

**Risk**: Guest house overbooking (only 8 suites)
**Mitigation**: Promote weekday visits, list Bishnupur alternatives, implement waitlist

**Risk**: Outdated content damages trust
**Mitigation**: "Last Updated" dates, quarterly audits, user feedback loop
