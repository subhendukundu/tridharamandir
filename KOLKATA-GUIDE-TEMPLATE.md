---

#### FAQ 1: Is Kolkata to Panchmura doable as a day trip?

**H3**: "1. Is Kolkata to Panchmura doable as a day trip?"

Technically yes, but not recommended. Day trip requires leaving Kolkata by 6 AM, arriving Panchmura 10 AM, attending 12:30 PM prasad and 6:30 PM arati, returning by 8 PM (arrive Kolkata 11:30 PM). That's a 15-hour day with 8 hours driving/transit.

**Better option**: Overnight weekend trip lets you experience morning mangal arati (5 AM), volunteer seva, and Bishnupur temple tour without rush. Guest house rates (₹7,200/night) are comparable to time/energy saved.

**Verdict**: Day trip = exhausting. Weekend stay = immersive and worthwhile.

#### FAQ 4: Is prasad at Tridhara really free? What's the catch?

**H3**: "4. Is prasad at Tridhara really free? What's the catch?"

**Answer** (70 words):
**Yes, 100% free with no catch.** Anna-daan (community kitchen) is funded by donations and serves 2,000 devotees daily at 12:30 PM.

**Menu**: Khichuri (lentil-rice), seasonal sabji, chutney, Bengali sweets. Authentic sattvic meal (no onion/garlic).

**Who can eat?** Everyone, regardless of religion, caste, or background. First-come, first-served. Seating accommodates 200+ at a time.

**Optional donation**: Visitors often contribute ₹51, ₹101, or more to support the kitchen, but it's voluntary. No pressure.

**Alternative**: If prasad timing (12:30 PM) doesn't fit your schedule, guest house includes breakfast/dinner in accommodation rates.

#### FAQ 5: What are Tridhara's temple timings? When is the best arati?

**H3**: "5. What are Tridhara's temple timings? When is the best arati?"

**Answer** (75 words):
- **Gates Open**: 5:00 AM - 9:00 PM (weekdays), till 9:30 PM (weekends)
- **Mangal Arati**: 5:00 AM (intimate, 50-100 devotees)

#### FAQ 6: Do I need a car, or is public transport enough?

**H3**: "6. Do I need a car, or is public transport enough?"

**Answer** (80 words):
**Depends on your schedule and budget.**

**Public Transport (Train + Shared Trekker)**:
✅ Pros: Cheapest (₹1,200 return for 2 people), scenic train ride, eco-friendly
❌ Cons: Less flexible, Bishnupur side-trip requires hiring taxi anyway, last train back early (6 PM from Bishnupur)

**Private Car (Rental or Own)**:
✅ Pros: Flexibility (Bishnupur detour, leave anytime), comfort, luggage space
❌ Cons: More expensive (₹2,500+ fuel/tolls), 4-hour drive each way

**Recommendation for Kolkata visitors**:
- **Weekend trip with Bishnupur tour**: Rent car (₹3,500-5,000 for 2 days with driver)
- **Temple-only focus**: Train + shared trekker is sufficient
- **Group of 4+**: Car becomes cost-effective (split ₹5,000 = ₹1,250/person)

## WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES

### Tone & Voice:
- **Warm, welcoming, devotional** but not preachy
- **Practical and actionable** - every sentence serves a purpose
- **Specific over generic** - Use numbers (2,000 devotees, ₹7,200, 4 hours)
- **Conversational but respectful** - Like a knowledgeable friend giving advice
- **Cultural sensitivity** - Explain traditions for first-time temple visitors

### Language:
- **Active voice** - "Take the 6:15 AM train" not "The train should be taken"
- **Short sentences** - 15-20 words average for readability
- **Headings & subheadings** - Every 100-150 words for scanability
- **Bullet points** - Use extensively for lists, steps, options
- **Bold for emphasis** - Key information (times, costs, locations)

### SEO Best Practices:
- **Primary keyword in H1** - "Visit Tridhara Milan Mandir from Kolkata"
- **Secondary keywords in H2s** - "how to reach Panchmura", "weekend itinerary", etc.
- **Natural keyword integration** - 1.0-2.0% density, readable
- **LSI keywords** - Radha-Krishna, anna-daan, prasad, darshan, arati, terracotta, Bishnupur
- **Internal links** - 3-5 per 500 words (link to /guest-house, /services, /events)
- **External links** - IRCTC, Google Maps (open in new tab)

### Formatting:
- **Tables** - Cost breakdowns, train schedules, distance matrices
- **Numbered lists** - Step-by-step processes (booking, itinerary)
- **Checkboxes** - Checklists (what to bring, booking confirmations)
- **Blockquotes** - Testimonials, Pro Tips
- **Callout boxes** - Important warnings (book ahead for festivals)

### Cultural Authenticity:
- **Use devotee language** - "Mangal arati", "prasad", "darshan", "sankirtan"
- **Explain terms** - First use: "mangal arati (morning ceremony)"
- **Bengali references** - "Naba-Vrindavan (Second Vrindavan)"
- **Respect traditions** - Explain etiquette (remove footwear, dress modestly)
